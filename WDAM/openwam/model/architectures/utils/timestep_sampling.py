"""Pluggable timestep samplers for joint video-action flow-matching training.

``BaseWAMArchitecture.compute_loss`` (and ``DualSystemIDMArchitecture.compute_loss``)
expose a ``decoupled_sampler`` hook: when supplied, the per-sample video and
action diffusion timesteps come from ``sampler.sample_timesteps(...)`` instead
of the default ``torch.randint`` draw. This module implements that hook.

``VarianceShiftTimestepSampler`` is the training-time counterpart to the
deploy-side ``schedule_type="variance_shift"`` schedule. Default
training behavior is unchanged: the trainer only builds a sampler when
``training.timestep_sampling`` selects one; otherwise ``compute_loss`` keeps its
legacy ``torch.randint`` path bit-for-bit.

Convention note (easy to trip on): the timesteps returned here are consumed by
``compute_loss`` as GRID-INDEX positions in ``[0, num_train_timesteps]`` -- a
*larger* returned value maps to a *higher* scheduler-grid index and thus a
*lower* sigma (cleaner). This is the OPPOSITE direction to the deploy-side
``openwam.deploy.denoise_schedule``, where a schedule entry IS the sigma value
(smaller == cleaner). Both sides are internally consistent; mind the direction
when comparing train vs inference code. ``VarianceShiftTimestepSampler`` and
the deploy ``variance_shift`` schedule both place each stream on
``alpha_shift(1 - cleanness, shift_stream)`` -- the same grid -- so a
variance_shift-trained checkpoint and its deploy schedule are point-wise
in-distribution (up to the training grid's 1/num_train quantization).

    """Latent-Forcing variance-shift correlated timestep sampler.

    Training counterpart to ``schedule_type="variance_shift"``: instead of two
    independent draws, draw one global ``u`` per sample and place the two
    streams on the alpha-shift curve -- the lead stream's cleanness is
    ``f_alpha(u) >= u`` so its sampled timestep is, on average, further denoised
    than the lag stream's. Training thus sees curve-correlated ``(t_v, t_a)``
    pairs matching the variance-shift inference path (Latent Forcing
    arXiv:2602.11401).

    Implements the same ``decoupled_sampler`` contract; ``compute_loss`` maps
    the returned timesteps onto the backbone sigma grid
    (``alpha_shift(1 - cleanness, shift)``), the same grid the deploy
    ``variance_shift`` schedule rides -- so train and deploy match point-wise.
