"""Self-contained architecture construction for finetune / resume.

When ``training.finetune_ckpt_path`` or ``training.resume_ckpt_path`` is set,
the trainer builds the architecture from that checkpoint directory alone:
module skeletons from the component specs saved in its ``config.yaml``,
weights from its latest ``checkpoint_step_*.safetensors`` (finetune) or
from accelerate's ``load_state`` after prepare (resume). The original
pretrained backbone directory (``model.video_backbone.model_path``) does not
need to exist on the training host.

Train-side counterpart of the deploy loader (``openwam/deploy/model_loader.py``),
kept independent so training never imports deploy code.
