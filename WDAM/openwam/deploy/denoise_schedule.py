"""Schedule generator composing two backbone-owned schedulers.

This module knows nothing about flow-matching math or specific backbone
formulas. It receives two scheduler references (video and action,
typically pulled from the architecture) and asks each to produce its own
timestep series via the duck-typed minimum interface:

    scheduler.set_timesteps(num_inference_steps, shift=...)
    scheduler.timesteps    # 1-D tensor / array

``schedule_sync`` returns a list of ``(t_video, t_action)`` pairs
describing the per-iteration noise levels for the joint denoising loop,
terminated with a ``(0.0, 0.0)`` sentinel.

Two strategies are supported:

- ``sync``           — both streams advance in lockstep on their own
  deterministic timestep series (default; unchanged behavior).
- ``variance_shift`` — Latent-Forcing-style ordered trajectory: one
  stream denoises earlier than the other along an alpha-shift curve
  (``alpha``, arXiv:2602.11401), with ``lead`` choosing which stream
  leads. Each stream rides its own ``alpha_shift`` grid (matching
  training), and ``alpha=1`` reproduces ``sync`` bit-for-bit.

The removed strategies (video_leading / cascade / action_only) live in
git history; ``make_schedule`` raises ``NotImplementedError`` for them.
